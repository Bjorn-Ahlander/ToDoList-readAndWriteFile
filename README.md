# readAndWriteFile
A console program for keeping track on what you have to do. With other words a traditional todo-list. The programs works fine and future improvements lay in:
- commenting better
- better names for variables, classes, methods, etc
- Extend error-handling
- Maybe one can also improve the communication with the end-user

I learned a lot about c# during the work with this projectAdd project files.
